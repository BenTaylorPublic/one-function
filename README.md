## Description
OneFunction isn't just a program, it's a programming **philosophy**. Too long have we been plagued with the false promises of Object Orientated Programming. Functional Programming isn't much better either, it's spaghetti structure adds code smell and unprecedented complexity.

**OneFunction** comes to save the day. Taking the core concepts of procuderal programming, and the vastly loved **recursion** practice.

As the name implies, all programs should be written with a **single function**, and **recursion** should be used to extend the programs functionality.
